### Details
- **Excellent**: The expectation for this has gone beyond the minimum requirements and is well organized.
- **Met**: The minimum requirement has been met but could possible use some clean up.
- **Poor**: The minimum requirement has been met complete and still need works.
- **NA**: This has either not been started or needs a significant amount of work to be done. It would be suggested to reach out to either your instructor or a teaching assistant.

### File Structure
What is considered in this portion is how well the the layout of the file is frame based on the instructions provided and prompts within the framed file.

Classes, methods, object creations, and console.logs are placed where it can be easily read.

### Store Class
The overall build of the Store class will be considered for this section. The `factory method`, `constructor`, and the required `methods` have been created.

### Methods
The methods within the Store class will consider if they are manipulating the proper set of data and responding correctly.

### Product Class
This will consider the overall build of the Product class. Does the `constructor` meet the project requirements?

### Object Creation
Are the correct amount of stores and items being creation? Each store has the expected amount of items per the instructions.

Tests have been crafted to detail the required items to be added to inventories, sold, and detail the required amounts of instructed keys.

**Note:** *The instructions do note that you can add as many items to a store as desired; however, adding more items will not be considered doing "more" for this section.*
